A Web3 based donation platform built on the Tezos blockchain. Ateru aims to make the act of donating transparent and incentivising using the power of blockchain

_Built during the HackNITP Hackathon organised by NIT Patna on the Healthcare and Open Innovation tracks_

Please note that as this was a 48 hour hackathon, we could not make the site responsive. We built it with reference to the 14" breakpoint

## 🤔What is Ateru?

Ateru is a web3 based donation and fundraising platform. With this product, we aim to solve the problems the existing donation platforms pose - lack of transparency, incentive to donate and heavy convenience fees.

We propose a clean and incentivsing model to bridge the apprehension gap between a philanthropic individual and a donor with the power and transparency of web3. Our intention is not making money, with a 0% cut in donation fees, we wish to empower the needy.

Kindness is a virtue that should be rewarded, every donor gets a customised flaunt-worthy NFT for every donation.

## 💱More on the Usage of Tezos

Clicking the "Login" button in the navbar will open this prompt window and you can choose any wallet to sign in. Currently, as the Tezos testnet endpoint was throwing some errors at our end, we weren't able to test the working, but have written code for login, logout, send and receive XTZ in `App.js`
